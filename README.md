# 🤖 Google AI Agents Intensive: 5-Day Bootcamp & Capstone

This repository documents my journey through the **5-Day Generative AI Agents Course** by Google and Kaggle. It contains all daily exercises, advanced concepts, and my final Capstone project.

## 🏆 Capstone Project: InfoSynthesizer
**The Context-Aware Research Assistant**

For my final project, I built **InfoSynthesizer**, a Concierge Agent that acts as an intelligent research team.
* **Goal:** Automate complex topic research while tailoring the output to the user's professional persona.
* **Architecture:** Sequential orchestration of a Parallel research team (Tech & Market researchers).
* **Key Tech:** Google ADK, Gemini 2.5 Flash, InMemory Memory Service.

## 📚 Course Roadmap

### **Day 1: Foundations & Architecture**
* Built my first AI Agent using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK).
* Moved from single-agent setups to **Multi-Agent Systems**.
* Explored **Sequential** vs. **Parallel** architectures.

### **Day 2: Advanced Tooling**
* Created custom **Python Function Tools** for agents.
* Implemented tools for real-time data fetching (Google Search).
* Learned to connect agents to external APIs.

### **Day 3: State & Memory**
* Mastered **Context Engineering**.
* Implemented **Short-term (Session)** vs. **Long-term (Memory Bank)** storage.
* Built agents that "remember" user preferences across conversations.

### **Day 4: Observability & Evaluation**
* Integrated **Logging** and **Tracing** to debug agent thought processes.
* Learned how to evaluate agent performance and reliability.

### **Day 5: Deployment & Scale**
* Explored the **Agent2Agent (A2A)** protocol for decentralized agent communication.
* Learned deployment strategies for **Vertex AI Agent Engine**.
