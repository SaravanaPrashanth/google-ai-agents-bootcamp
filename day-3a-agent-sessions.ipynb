This holds immense promise for tackling diseases that have been historically difficult to treat.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** from my previous answer, which was:\n\n**2. Generative AI for Molecule Design**\n\nThis is a truly revolutionary area. Let's dive deeper into what it entails and why it's so significant:\n\n**What is Generative AI for Molecule Design?**\n\nTraditionally, drug discovery involved a lot of trial and error. Scientists would synthesize or screen vast libraries of existing molecules to see if any had the desired effect on a biological target. This is a slow, expensive, and often inefficient process.\n\nGenerative AI changes this paradigm by **creating novel molecules from scratch**. Instead of searching an existing library, it **generates** new molecular structures that have never existed before, specifically designed to meet certain criteria.\n\n**How Does it Work (Simplified)?**\n\nGenerative AI models, particularly those based on **Deep Learning**, learn the underlying rules and patterns of chemistry from enormous datasets of existing molecules. Think of it like learning a language: the AI learns the \"grammar\" and \"vocabulary\" of molecular structures.\n\nOnce trained, these models can be prompted with specific objectives, such as:\n\n*   \"Design a molecule that binds strongly to protein X.\"\n*   \"Create a molecule with low predicted toxicity and good solubility.\"\n*   \"Generate a molecule that is similar to compound Y but with improved efficacy.\"\n\nThe AI then uses its learned knowledge to propose entirely new molecular structures that are statistically likely to satisfy these requirements.\n\n**Key Techniques and Approaches:**\n\n*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation of molecular data and can then generate new data points from this compressed space.\n*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** GANs involve two neural networks – a generator that creates molecules and a discriminator that tries to distinguish between real and generated molecules. This adversarial process drives the generator to produce increasingly realistic and effective molecules.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning:** This approach can be used in conjunction with generative models to guide the molecule generation process towards specific desirable properties, like maximizing binding affinity.\n*   **Diffusion Models:** A more recent and powerful class of generative models that have shown remarkable success in generating high-quality, diverse molecular structures.\n\n**Why is this Development so Significant?**\n\n1.  **Unprecedented Novelty:** Generative AI can explore vast chemical spaces that are simply inaccessible through traditional methods. This means it can discover entirely new classes of compounds with unique mechanisms of action, potentially leading to breakthrough therapies for previously untreatable diseases.\n2.  **Increased Efficiency and Speed:** Instead of synthesizing and testing thousands of compounds, researchers can use AI to generate a much smaller, highly optimized set of candidates to prioritize for synthesis and lab testing. This dramatically speeds up the preclinical phase.\n3.  **Tailored Drug Design:** AI can design molecules with specific properties in mind from the outset, such as:\n    *   **High binding affinity:** How well the drug sticks to its target.\n    *   **Good pharmacokinetic profile (ADMET):** How the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, excreted, and its toxicity.\n    *   **Reduced side effects:** By designing out structural features known to cause toxicity.\n    *   **Overcoming drug resistance:** Designing molecules that can bypass mechanisms that make existing drugs ineffective.\n4.  **Cost Reduction:** By accelerating the early stages of drug discovery and reducing the number of failed experiments, generative AI can significantly lower the overall cost of bringing a new drug to market.\n5.  **Democratization of Discovery:** As AI tools become more accessible, they can empower smaller research teams and even academic labs to engage in sophisticated drug discovery efforts.\n\n**Examples in Action:**\n\n*   Companies like **Exscientia** have used generative AI to design drug candidates that have progressed into clinical trials in relatively short timeframes.\n*   **Atomwise** uses deep learning for virtual screening and has also explored generative approaches.\n*   Numerous academic research groups are publishing groundbreaking work in this area, pushing the boundaries of what's possible.\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n*   **Validation:** Generated molecules still need rigorous experimental validation in the lab and in clinical trials.\n*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* an AI generated a particular molecule can sometimes be challenging.\n*   **Data Quality:** The performance of generative AI heavily relies on the quality and completeness of the chemical data it's trained on.\n*   **Integration:** Seamlessly integrating these AI tools into existing drug discovery workflows is an ongoing process.\n\nDespite these challenges, generative AI for molecule design is one of the most exciting frontiers in pharmaceutical research, promising to accelerate the development of new medicines and address unmet medical needs.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the main companies involved in **Generative AI for Molecule Design**.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
